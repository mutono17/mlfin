# Importing a module
import math  # This imports the math module, which contains mathematical functions and constants

# Variables
x = 5  # This is a variable. It stores the value 5.

# Data types
y = 3.14  # This is a float, a number with a decimal point.
z = "Hello, world!"  # This is a string, a sequence of characters.

# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # This is a list. It can store multiple values.

# Functions
def add_numbers(a, b):  # This is a function. It takes two inputs, a and b, and returns their sum.
    return a + b

# Calling a function
result = add_numbers(x, y)  # This calls the function add_numbers with inputs x and y, and stores the result in the variable 'result'.

# Conditional statements
if x > 0:  # This is an if statement. It checks if the condition (x > 0) is true.
    print("x is positive")  # This line is executed if the condition is true.
else:
    print("x is not positive")  # This line is executed if the condition is false.

# Loops
for i in my_list:  # This is a for loop. It iterates over each element in my_list.
    print(i)  # This line is executed for each iteration of the loop, with 'i' being the current element.

# Objects and classes
class MyClass:  # This is a class, a blueprint for creating objects.
    def __init__(self, name):  # This is the constructor method, called when a new object is created.
        self.name = name  # This creates an instance variable 'name'.

    def say_hello(self):  # This is an instance method. It can access and modify instance variables.
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")

my_object = MyClass("Alice")  # This creates a new object of type MyClass.
my_object.say_hello()  # This calls the say_hello method on the my_object object.

# Error handling
try:
    print(unknown_variable)  # This line of code will raise an error, because 'unknown_variable' is not defined.
except NameError:  # This block of code will be executed if a NameError is raised in the try block.
    print("An error occurred")

# Print a success message
print("This is a basic overview of Python syntax and concepts. Happy coding!")
